    <h3> Permissions You Give to Us. </h3>

    As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service. We do not claim ownership of your content that you share through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (including photos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.

    <h3> Content Removal </h3>

    We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies, or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you immediately to protect our community or services, if you violate these Terms of Use or our policies, or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service. For details on deleting your content or account, please refer to our <a href="privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy </a>.

    <h3> Updating These Terms </h3>

    We will notify existing users before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account.
