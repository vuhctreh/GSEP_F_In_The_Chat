    <h2>CoffeeClique Privacy Policy</h2>

    This privacy policy will explain how CoffeeClique uses the personal data we collect from you when you use our website.

    <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>

    To provide our Product, we must process information about you. We collect the following data:

    <ul>
      <li>Email, first and last name, University, whether you are staff member or a student</li>
      <li>Your year of study, course, and any cafe tables you have joined (interests you have registered)</li>
      <li>Tasks and posts you create</li>
      <li>Gamification data such as the number of points you have collected</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>

    You directly provide CoffeeClique with the data we collect. We collect and process data when you:
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up for an account</li>
      <li>Modify your data while using our website, such as registering interests</li>
      <li>Create or share content with others</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>How will we use your data?</h3>

    CoffeeClique collects your data so that we can provide our Product's functionality to you. We use the information we have to deliver our Product, including to personalise features and content (such as your Personal Feed and available Cafe Tables). Your individual interests are key to the features of our Product, and without your information we cannot provide the Product services to you.

    We also use the information we have to combat harmful conduct and promote safety and security. For example, to investigate suspicious activity or violations of our terms or policies, or to detect when someone needs help. In these cases, your data may be viewed by a relevant member of staff.

    <h3>How do we store your data?</h3>

    We store your data in our database which is hosted on IBM Cloud, and may be present on the personal computers of the development team during development. CoffeeClique will keep your data while the web app is active, unless you explicitly request your data to be deleted before this date. When you delete your account, we delete messages you have posted, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. Deletion will occur within 90 days, unless this is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems (in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible) or if deletion would restrict our ability to investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies; protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users; comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency.

    <h3>How is your data shared?</h3>

    Your information is shared with others when you interact with others in a group using our Product. Please consider that those you interact with could potentially download, screenshot, or re-share that content to others.

    Please note that CoffeeClique is a project for the University of Exeter class Group Software Engineering Project. Your data may therefore be accessible to relevant University of Exeter faculty, as well as the development team, as all our resources must be accessible to them for submissions.

    <h3>What are your data protection rights?</h3>

    CoffeeClique would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following:

    <ul>
      <li>The right to access – You have the right to request CoffeeClique for copies of your personal data.</li>
      <li> The right to rectification – You have the right to request that CoffeeClique correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request CoffeeClique to complete the information you believe is incomplete. </li>
      <li> The right to erasure – You have the right to request that CoffeeClique erase your personal data, under certain conditions. </li>
      <li> The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that CoffeeClique restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions. </li>
      <li> The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to CoffeeClique’s processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li> The right to data portability – You have the right to request that CoffeeClique transfer the data that we have collected to another organisation, or directly to you, under certain conditions. </li>
  </ul>

    If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at: igs205@exeter.ac.uk

    <h3>Legal requests and preventing harm</h3>

    We can access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others in response to a legal request, if we have a good-faith belief that the law requires us to do so; or when we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to detect, prevent and address fraud, violations of our terms or policies, other harmful or illegal activity.

    <h3>Privacy policies of other websites</h3>

    Please note that if you follow a link on the CoffeeClique website to other websites, our privacy policy applies only to our website, so you should read their privacy policy too.

    <h3>Changes to our privacy policy</h3>

    CoffeeClique keeps its privacy policy under regular review and places any updates on this web page. This privacy policy was last updated on 18 February 2021.

    <h3>How to contact us</h3>

    If you have any questions about CoffeeClique’s privacy policy, the data we hold on you, or you would like to exercise one of your data protection rights, please do not hesitate to contact us at igs205@exeter.ac.uk.

    <h3>How to contact the appropriate authority</h3>

    Should you wish to report a complaint or if you feel that CoffeeClique has not addressed your concern in a satisfactory manner, you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office, the relevant Data Protection Commissioner, or your local supervisory authority.
