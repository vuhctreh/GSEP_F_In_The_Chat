This is a submission for Sprint 1. There are three types of document that you will find the following places.

## PROCESS DOCUMENTS

Our process documents are managed using Trello. The link to our project page is below. We have added mattcollison2 to the board so it is visible.

We have also taken regular snapshots of the kanban board to archive our progress. These are can be found in [./process-documents/kanban-snapshots/] and are also available on Google Drive via the following link:

## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS

Our technical documents are primarily managed on github. The link to the project is below:

The source code in the main branch of this repository at the time of submission can also be found in [./technical-documents/]. The technical documents are structured as is required for the IBM Cloud deployment.

Please note that due to issues with IBM cloud, we have had to migrate files to this new repository. Therefore, the contributions of team members committing to the repository may not accurately reflect how we split tasks within the team for the migrated files. The old GitHub repository (no longer used) can however be viewed at the following link:

## PRODUCT DOCUMENTS

UI mockup designs can be found in [./product-documents/UI]. Interactive versions for mobile and desktop views are also available at the following links, demonstrating the flow of the system:
* Mobile view:  [https://www.figma.com/proto/o49gPj298gAeACQhbLPMRN/mockup-mobile?node-id=12%3A5&viewport=356%2C278%2C0.09047818183898926&scaling=scale-down]
* Desktop view: [https://www.figma.com/proto/VwGaAOo1yHLmI4WkdGwWR2/mockup-desktop?node-id=33%3A300&scaling=scale-down]
Videos of this interactive view are also in [./product-documents/UI].

An integral part of our requirements analysis was surveying a variety of current University students. The directory [./product-documents/requirements-analysis] contains the survey questions, raw results of this survey, and summarised results. Participation in the survey was strictly voluntary and responses are anonymous.
Based upon this data and discussion in meetings, this directory also contains a tentative version release plan, where our planned features are listed and prioritised using the MoSCoW system.

The majority of our design was agreed as a team in meetings, and is documented in the meeting minutes. The directory [./product-documents/designs] thus contains only the database schema.

The requirements analysis documents and database schema are can also be accessed via Google Drive:
