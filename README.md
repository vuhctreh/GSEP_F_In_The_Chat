## About the project

This is our development github page for our group project.

It is a web app developed in Django.

It is a website to keep students engage during the pandemic by having them do challenges in groups. This helps with social life by creating an online space where students can interact with each other by tackling fun and rewarding tasks together. Students can meet others with shared interests at tables in our 'cafe' and have a sense of community.


## HOSTED WEBSITE

the website is hosted on IBM Cloud
